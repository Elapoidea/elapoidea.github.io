Greetings. My name is Asher Grizzaffi. I am an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics currently studying at the University of Texas at Dallas. I transferred from Collin College, where I was the founder and president of the Chess Club, and where I was nominated as president of the Math Club and Mu Alpha Theta on several occasions. During my time at Collin, I also collaborated with Dr. Dustin Potter to write and (hopefully soon) publish a mathematical paper in nonstandard analysis.
