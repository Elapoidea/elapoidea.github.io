Greetings. My name is Asher Grizzaffi. I am an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics currently studying at the University of Texas at Dallas. I transferred from Collin College, where I was the founder and president of the Chess Club, and where I was nominated as president of the Math Club and Mu Alpha Theta on several occasions. During my time at Collin, I also collaborated with Dr. Dustin Potter to write and (hopefully soon) publish a mathematical paper in nonstandard analysis. 

I am now taking Analysis 2, Algebra 2, and Differential Geometry at UTD. As I am finishing up my paper with Dr. Potter, I have begun two new research projects in Knot Theory and Analytic Number Theory at UTD. I anticipate that this my last difficult semester before I graduate at the end of the year, so my goal is to use my time with research and my free time to begin building some amount of expertise in more specialized areas of mathematics.
